# UtilityPrograms
### Utility programs written in Python.

* Purge Files: is a program that purges an entire directory or file given user input. The user is prompted 3 times before deleting something so that it is hard to accidentally delete something. 

#### USING THE PROGRAM (Disclaimer I have only used and tested this on Linux Ubuntu 14.04 and Linux Ubuntu 16.04)
##### Step 1 - Download the purge program from https://github.com/MorrisLaw/UtilityPrograms via the "clone or download" link.
##### Step 2 - cd to the path where you've installed the program, then navigate to purge.py.
  * This is the python script that will be run.
  
##### Step 3 - While in terminal, run the command 'python3 purge.py' to start the script. 
  * This uses the python 3 interpreter, so make sure you have python 3 installed. You can get it from https://www.python.org/downloads/.
